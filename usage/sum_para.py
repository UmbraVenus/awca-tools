text = " Undesirable Aliens in Nineteenth Century United States: How Immigrants Became Citizens When the first gathered Congress of the United States of America declared the country’s independence from the British Empire in the summer of 1776, notions of who comprised this new country were nebulous, subject to scrutiny and debate. In the Articles of Confederation produced the same year, there were no laws or articles addressing immigration to the U.S. or American citizenship. This absence of clarity on the composition of America’s people reflected concerns surrounding identity held by the founding leaders of the country as the U.S. aimed to assert itself as a sovereign nation among European empires and monarchies.1 It was not until twelve years later, with the Constitution of 1788 that laws concerning migration and naturalization of citizens began to come into focus. More clarity to the parameters of citizenship arrived with a law in 1790 specifying a two-year residency period for white (European) immigrants to become naturalized citizens. As understandings of American citizenship developed and refined, so did notions of racial hierarchies and boundaries. The construction of America’s citizens involved the construction of noncitizens, a parallel and opposing idea to citizenship that reinforced who belonged in the newly formed United States. Concepts of both race and citizenship were utilized to characterize who belonged in the United States and who did not. In the eighteenth century, the United States consisted of a variety of people who had traveled to the U.S., or descended from people who had traveled there, for a multitude of 1 Meg Gudgeirsson Week 2 Lecture 1; Liz Covart, “Terri Halperin, The Alien & Sedition Acts of 1798.” Ben Franklin’s World reasons, both voluntary and involuntary. Europeans continually arrived in the U.S., with hopes of both improving personal opportunities and expanding imperial wealth and power, from before its independence through the end of the 19th century. Throughout this time as well, descendants of Africans who were kidnapped, sold into slavery, and shipped to ports all throughout the Americas lived in the U.S. either as slaves or free people, albeit at a subjugated status to white, European Americans. The United States as a nation became a place where European immigrants who were deprived of basic resources and rights in their home countries found great opportunity and belonging. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur, a naturalized American citizen, spoke to this sense of belonging in his letters in 1782, asking “what attachment can a poor European emigrant have for a country where he had nothing?”2 In comparison to the countries from which Europeans emigrated from, the United States was a place of favorable circumstances where one’s hard work paid off, one’s life “counted for something,” and one could flourish in life.3 However, at the same time as de Crèvecoeur writes about citizens’ freedoms and the civil government of the U.S., such opportunities to rights and freedom were denied from the enslaved African Americans exploited for their labor and indigenous Americans who had lived on that land for centuries. In 1798, President John Adams signed the Alien and Sedition Acts into law, making clear distinctions between American citizens and non-American immigrants by delineating who belonged in the U.S. In these acts, immigrants were understood to be potential threats to the U.S.; the two acts concerning “aliens” made it lawful to remove immigrants from the country if they were seen as a potential threat to the U.S., or if they were from an enemy country with Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur, Letters from an American Farmer, 22. 3 St. John de Crèvecoeur,. Letters from an American Farmer, 22-28. which the U.S. was engaged in war.4 These acts also increased the naturalization period to fourteen years, construing new arrivals to the U.S. to be outsiders in their status as noncitizens.5 Additionally, they specified that every ship captain arriving at U.S. ports had to announce how many immigrants (aliens) were on the ship, specifying “the place of nativity, the country from which they shall have come, and the nation to which they belong and owe allegiance.”6 In this way, the Alien Acts reveal how immigrants were primarily understood by their non-citizenship, calling into question their allegiance to other countries as a possible threat to the United States as well as imposing boundaries upon becoming a U.S. citizen. Along with the creation of American citizens’ duties and allegiance during this time, the notion of “others” which both threatened and opposed U.S. citizenship took form. For instance, as discussed by David Roediger, Catholic Irish immigrants to the U.S. were met by “large nativist political movements [who] resented their religion, their poverty, and their presence.”7 Nativism was a movement consisting of Protestant, white (European), native-born Americans centered around hostility towards immigrants.8 Nativists wanted to change immigration laws to increase the naturalization period to twenty-one years, which further enforced perceptions of immigrants as undeserving of citizenship and belonging in the United States. Further, they supported preventing poor and disabled people from immigrating to the U.S. and even deporting such people from U.S. ports.9 This displayed nativists’ vision for an ideal United States with financially stable and able-bodied people as its citizens, without the burdens of noncitizen"
